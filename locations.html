          “Arc-de-Triomphe” like archway in the middle of a crossroad. Almost
          similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian
          soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the
          World War I. India Gate was built during the British era. The
          foundation was laid by the Duke of Cannaught in 1921 while its
          structure was designed by the renowned architect, Sir Edwin Landseer
          Lutyens. Later, after gaining independence Amar Jawan Jyoti was added
          to honour the martyrs of the armed forces.

          The Howrah Bridge is a balanced cantilever bridge over the Hooghly
          River in West Bengal. Commissioned in 1943,[9][11] the bridge was
          originally named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced a pontoon
          bridge at the same location linking the cities of Howrah and Kolkata
          (Calcutta). On 14 June 1965, it was renamed Rabindra Setu after the
          great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first Indian and
          Asian Nobel laureate.[11] It is still popularly known as the Howrah
          Bridge. The bridge is one of four on the Hooghly River and is a famous
          symbol of Kolkata and West Bengal. The other bridges are the
          Vidyasagar Setu (popularly called the Second Hooghly Bridge), the
          Vivekananda Setu and the relatively new Nivedita Setu.
